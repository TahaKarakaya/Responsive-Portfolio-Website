# Responsive-Portfolio-Website 🔥🍂


# Create a responsive personal portfolio website design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


Hello friends.
If I want to explain this project briefly, it is a CV site.
The languages used in it are only Html, Css and Js.

# In the site:
1.Home page
2.About me
3.My Experience
4.My Services
5.My Portfolio
6.Testimonial
7.Contact Me

# As for the steps you need to do:
1) Download the project exactly.
2) If you want to change the photos, replace them with the photos with the same name as in the photos in the file or show the path of the new photos from within the css codes.
3) All social media links are left blank. Go to the relevant place in the Html section to fill them in for yourself.
4) Certain color scales are placed in the top section of the CSS. Color can be changed from there as desired.
5) It should also be noted that it is compatible with all devices.
6) Finally, the CSS codes are written in great detail. You can play on it as much as you want.

# You can support me by throwing a star on the project. I will also add the live version of the site here. I recommend that you take a look at it.
